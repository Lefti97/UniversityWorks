Covid19 Application

The program was written in Netbeans(Java 8) and uses JavaFX gui.

It uses an xlsx file from this link:
https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/COVID-19-geographic-disbtribution-worldwide.xlsx
that has global official daily records of Covid19 cases, deaths etc.

The xlsx file is copied to a TableView(JavaFX) using Apache POI
and shows LineChart statistics for each country.

The xlsx file must be placed inside the project directory (Covid19_Application).
