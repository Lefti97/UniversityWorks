description = "American Gothic is a 1930 painting by Grant Wood in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago. 

Wood was inspired to paint what is now known as the American Gothic House in Eldon, Iowa, along with \"the kind of people [he] fancied should live in that house\". It depicts a farmer standing beside his daughter â€“ often mistakenly assumed to be his wife. The painting's name is a word play on the house's architectural style, Carpenter Gothic."
